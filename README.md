# Insure-Landing-Page-TLP
Frontend Mentor Challenge Project

![Design Preview for Huddle Landing Page with Curved Background Challenge from Frontend Mentor](./design/desktop-preview.jpg) 

## Background
I completed this design using the Bootstrap framework and Sass. I learned about using **@extend** to copy styles from other elements and about using **srcset** for responsive images: ![Multimedia and Embedding Responsive Images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images)

I realized I could design for mobile and tablet using responsive navbar. The default design of the website is mobile. I have added media queries for the following minimum screen widths:

1. desktop size: media screen and min-width 1280px;
2. tablet size: media screen and min-width: 700px;
